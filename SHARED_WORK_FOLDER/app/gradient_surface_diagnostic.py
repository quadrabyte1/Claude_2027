# v0.26 — 2026-10-20 Topo — Fix missing sand trap (Delaveaga H5 Trap 1).
#         export_trap_stls swallowed "apply_sand_texture produced non-watertight trap
#           mesh" and the trap vanished from the 3MF.  Cause: for a long ring chord
#           (5.8 mm) Delaunay drops the ring edge, ring-stitch adds a fan triangle, then
#           _earcut_interior_pinholes added a 2nd overlapping top triangle on the same
#           ring edge (its dup-guard allowed count<2 even for ring edges, which also get
#           a wall face) -> non-manifold edge -> NM prune opened holes.
#         _earcut_interior_pinholes: ring edges now limited to ONE top face.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v5.65.
# v0.26b — 2026-10-22 Topo — Fix missing sand trap (Stanford H8) + loud failures.
#         _fill_missing_ring_edges nearest-fan chose an apex whose triangle (A,B,apex)
#           overlapped existing faces (contained a vertex / crossed an edge) -> unclosable
#           pinhole -> non-watertight -> trap silently dropped.  Fan apex must now give
#           a non-overlapping triangle.  export_trap_stls also records PIPELINE_WARNINGS, returned by
#           /api/generate_models and shown in the editor.  APP_VERSION v5.66.
# v0.25 — 2026-10-15 Topo — Bunker rake ridges follow the long axis (reverses task #610).
#         Thomas: "Bunker rake lines should run parallel to the long axis of a bunker."
#         SAND_RAKE_ALIGN_TO_MAJOR_AXIS flipped to True (was False since #610, when
#           Thomas preferred fixed-Y over the #606 PCA version).
#         Axis now from new _polygon_long_axis(): principal axis of the filled polygon's
#           second moments of area (holes subtracted), NOT SVD on ring vertices, which
#           was skewed by dense vertices along curved edges.  Near-isotropic shapes
#           (Imax/Imin < SAND_RAKE_ISOTROPIC_RATIO) fall back to fixed Y.
#         Only Z of top vertices changes; watertight guard/closure passes untouched.
# v0.24 — 2026-10-13 Sienna — Green/fringe interface normalisation (task 780).
#         New constant: FRINGE_BLEND_CELLS = 3 (tune the blend band width).
#         New function: _normalize_green_fringe_interface — cosine-weighted blend
#           of the TPS fringe surface toward green boundary Z within the blend band.
#           Called once in build_fringe_mesh after _build_tps_grid_height_field,
#           before the per-cell Z assignment loop.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v5.35.
# v0.23 — 2026-10-11 Topo — Fix StrackaLine arrow detection (task 760).
#         build_dark_mask_inside_green: add second detection branch (b) for
#           StrackaLine's dark-navy arrows (HSV≈(104,255,90), RGB≈(0,50,90)).
#           Old branch (a) V<50 is kept for legacy GolfLogix near-black arrows.
#           New branch (b): H=90-135 AND S>150 AND V<105 — catches the saturated
#           navy that StrackaLine uses without pulling in the blue-green turf
#           (which has V≈150-190 and is safely above the V<105 ceiling).
#         detect_arrows: raise max_arrow_area default 600→1200 to cover
#           StrackaLine arrow blobs measured at 400-1108 px.
#         save_arrow_vs_output_overlay: new helper — two-panel PNG (arrows on
#           source image + reconstructed height map) used by verification scripts
#           and owner_inbox/gen_arrow_overlay.py.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v5.27.
# v0.22 — 2026-10-06 Sienna — Include Fringe Without Grass flip (task 724).
#         Plate 1: ALWAYS grassy — removed if enable_fringe_grass: guard; grass
#           is unconditional on the main fringe regardless of checkbox.
#         Plate 2: smooth (grass-LESS) fringe sample — only built when
#           include_fringe_without_grass=True. Named "fringe_no_grass_sample"
#           (renamed from "fringe_grass_sample") → still extruder 2.
#         run_pipeline parameter: enable_fringe_grass → include_fringe_without_grass
#           (new semantics: controls plate-2 presence, not plate-1 grass).
#         _inject_bambu_extruder_metadata: _PLATE2_SCENE_NAME updated to
#           "fringe_no_grass_sample"; plater_name updated to "Fringe No Grass Sample".
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v5.13.
# v0.21 — 2026-10-06 Finn — Two-plate 3MF output (task 718).
#         Plate 1: unchanged full plaque (green + fringe[checkbox] + traps + water + boulders).
#         Plate 2: fringe grass sample — fringe mesh with grass UNCONDITIONALLY enabled,
#           named "fringe_grass_sample" in the scene → extruder 2 (same as fringe).
#         run_pipeline: builds fringe_grass_sample after main fringe in step 7a-ii;
#           adds it to scene AFTER all plate-1 objects so its objectid is highest.
#         _inject_bambu_extruder_metadata: when fringe_grass_sample is in scene_names,
#           generates TWO <plate> blocks with <model_instance> mappings; injects
#           plate_2.png / plate_no_light_2.png / top_2.png / pick_2.png (copied from
#           plate-1 templates as placeholders — Bambu regenerates on first slice).
#         test_enable_fringe_grass.py T10 updated: with plate-2 always building grass,
#           enableFringeGrass=False yields exactly 1 grass call (plate-2 only), not 0.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v5.08.
# v0.20 — 2026-10-05 Topo — Trap altitude grid-cell override (task 716).
#         New rule: if one or more user-set gridCellHeights entries have their
#         cell CENTRE inside a trap polygon, use mean(values) as the flat trap Z
#         instead of the default min(fringe boundary Z) - 2 mm rule.
#         New helper: _trap_grid_override(trap_poly_mm, grid_cell_heights,
#           cell_side, half) — returns float mean or None (no override).
#         Only SET cells (entries in gridCellHeights) are tested; absent cells
#         carry Poisson defaults and must NOT trigger the override.
#         Shapely .contains() strict interior: cell centres on the polygon
#         boundary are excluded.
#         Multiple contained cells → np.mean([values]) (mean policy).
#         Wired into export_trap_stls flat-mode path immediately after the
#         fringe-min default is computed; override replaces it when not None.
#         Curved-mode path (TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED=True) is unchanged.
#         All other pipelines (rake, fringe, green, water) unchanged.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v5.07.
# v0.19 — 2026-10-04 Topo — Strip sand chunks + floor guard; revert trap to flat+rake (task 708).
#         TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED flipped back to False (default was True since task 666).
#         Flat rule: trap_Z = min(fringe boundary Z) + TRAP_FRINGE_OFFSET_MM (-2 mm).
#         Removed: SAND_CHUNK_HEIGHT_MM, SAND_CHUNK_SIGMA_MM, SAND_CHUNK_DENSITY_PER_100_MM2,
#           SAND_CHUNK_MAX, SAND_CHUNK_MIN, SAND_CHUNK_UP_FRACTION, SAND_CHUNK_FLOOR_THICKNESS_MM.
#         Removed: _scatter_sand_chunks() helper function.
#         Removed: chunk-scatter pass + floor guard from apply_sand_texture().
#         Kept: TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED flag (False default, True path still reachable).
#         Kept: rake lines (cosine wave; see v0.25 for the current axis rule).
#         Kept: base_z_map param in apply_sand_texture (API stable for curved path).
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v5.03.
# v0.18 — 2026-10-04 Topo — 20×20 grid-cell TPS height field (task 704).
#         Wires gridCellHeights EGM field into the fringe surface via TPS.
#         New function _build_tps_grid_height_field():
#           1. Computes default Z for each of 400 cell centres via nearest-
#              boundary KDTree lookup on bnd_z (Poisson green boundary Z).
#           2. Merges user-set values from egm["gridCellHeights"] over defaults.
#           3. Fits TPS (RBFInterpolator, thin_plate_spline, smoothing=0) over
#              all 400 (cell_cx, cell_cy, cell_z) constraints.
#         build_fringe_mesh: replaces task-700 _z_nn_grid (nearest-boundary
#         extension) with _z_tps_grid from _build_tps_grid_height_field().
#         Degenerate case (no gridCellHeights): all 400 cells = Poisson default
#         → TPS is a C²-smooth approximation of the old NN extension.
#         User-set cells propagate via TPS blend; seam-reseat still overrides
#         the innermost ring from g_bdry_arr.
#         _build_tps_base() preserved intact (unused on this path).
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v5.01.
# v0.17 — 2026-10-04 Topo — Default fringe Z = nearest green boundary Z (task 700).
#         Thomas's spec: "the elevation of the fringe should be the same as the
#         corresponding elevation in the green across that interface and all the
#         way out to the edge of the frame."
#         For each fringe cell (x, y), find the nearest point on the green polygon
#         boundary (gbnd KDTree), look up the Poisson green surface Z at that
#         boundary point (bnd_z array), and hold that Z constant all the way out
#         to the frame edge.  No decay toward BASE_THICKNESS_MM.
#         Result: the fringe becomes a radial "extension" of the green rim.
#         Tilted green (5 mm one side, 10 mm opposite) → fringe mirrors the tilt
#         as a pair of plateaus with a smooth Voronoi-split transition at corners.
#         Replaced: the TPS global-height-field path (_z_tps_grid driven by 16
#         outer-frame anchors at BASE_THICKNESS_MM) is no longer the source of
#         green_edge_h.  The TPS primitive _build_tps_base() is KEPT INTACT for
#         the future grid-cell mechanism (user-set cells override the default
#         nearest-boundary Z locally via TPS).
#         _raw_fbh anchors are already embedded in bnd_z (task 658 Approach A),
#         so user-set fringe boundary heights propagate through the new path
#         automatically — no change to the anchor override logic.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v4.99.
# v0.16 — 2026-10-03 Topo — Complete strip of Gaussian spike-application code (task 698).
#         Continued from v0.15 partial: actually deleted _raw_spikes loop,
#         SPIKE_SIGMA_MM / SPIKE_INFLUENCE_MM / SPIKE_HARD_MAX_MM constants,
#         _skipped_in_green counter, Gaussian MAX-blend loop, post-filter
#         FINAL spike-scan with spike-exclusion mask, and _tps_spikes collector.
#         TPS call site now passes elevation_spikes_mm=[] explicitly.
#         elevationSpikes in EGM is accepted-but-ignored: deprecation notice
#         printed by _build_tps_base (parameter stays for API stability).
#         All SA1-SA7 tests green.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v4.98.
# v0.15 — 2026-10-02 Topo — Strip Gaussian spike-application code; keep TPS (task 698).
#         Thomas pivot: drop the entire OCR→elevationSpikes→Gaussian-bump pipeline.
#         Removed:  _raw_spikes loop, SPIKE_SIGMA_MM / SPIKE_INFLUENCE_MM /
#           SPIKE_HARD_MAX_MM constants, _skipped_in_green counter, Gaussian MAX-blend
#           loop, post-filter FINAL spike-scan with spike-exclusion mask.
#         Kept:  _build_tps_base() and its 16-point outer-frame base ring.  With both
#           fringeBoundaryHeights and elevationSpikes now ignored, the TPS is driven
#           solely by the 16 frame anchors → flat surface at BASE_THICKNESS_MM.
#           Thomas's future slope-arrow Poisson green surface + manual fringe-height
#           mechanism will supply new height constraints via a new argument or source.
#         elevation_spikes_mm in _build_tps_base is now DEPRECATED / ignored
#           (same pattern as fringe_boundary_heights_mm in task 690).
#           Callers that still pass it will see a log notice but no error.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v4.98.
# v0.14 — 2026-10-02 Topo — Strip fringeBoundaryHeights from TPS constraints (task 690).
#         Thomas's revelation: exterior fringe numbers (10/15/20/25/30) are
#         *distance-from-pin markers*, NOT altitudes.  The fringeBoundaryHeights
#         constraint source shipped in v4.81→v4.91 was semantically wrong.
#         _build_tps_base() now IGNORES fringe_boundary_heights_mm entirely.
#         Parameter kept for API stability (Sienna removes callers in T2 / task 691).
#         A deprecation notice is logged when non-empty fbh is passed.
#         TPS base surface now shaped by: interior elevationSpikes + 16 outer-frame
#         anchors at BASE_THICKNESS_MM only.  Fringe region interpolates smoothly
#         between spike-driven green interior Z and base.  No crease, no artifact.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v4.93 (Sienna landed v4.92 first on task 691).
# v0.13 — 2026-10-02 Topo — TPS global height field (task 684).
#         Replaces fragmented IDW/griddata patchwork base surface with a single
#         thin-plate-spline fit over all constraints:
#           • fringe-boundary anchors (snapped to nearest green-boundary vertex)
#           • interior elevation spikes
#           • 16 outer-frame anchors at BASE_THICKNESS_MM (prevent blow-up)
#         TPS is C²-smooth everywhere → no undefined derivative at fringe/green
#         seam.  Solver: scipy.interpolate.RBFInterpolator(kernel="thin_plate_spline",
#         smoothing=0.0).  Fallback to flat BASE_THICKNESS_MM when < 5 constraints.
#         Co-located constraints with conflicting Z are averaged.
#         All downstream pipelines preserved: trap (curved per-point), rake,
#         sand chunks, water (flat slab), dip-floor guard, seam-reseat.
#         Added _build_tps_base() public helper for unit testing.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v4.91.
# v0.12 — 2026-09-30 Topo — curved per-point trap surface is the new default (task 666).
#         Flip TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED: False → True.
#         Fix curved path: was using max(fringe Z within band) per ring sample —
#         now uses nearest-neighbor fringe Z per ring sample point (true per-point).
#         Old behavior on sloped fringe: low-end boundary picked max fringe (high side),
#         producing a gap > 2 mm at the low fringe point.  Now gap = 2 mm everywhere.
#         TRAP_FRINGE_OFFSET_MM = -2.0 unchanged.
#         TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED=False still restores flat min-2 (task 662 path).
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v4.84.
# v0.11 — 2026-09-30 Topo — flat-min trap surface (task 662).
#         Revert trap surface to flat scalar: Z = min(fringe boundary Z) - 2mm.
#         TRAP_FRINGE_OFFSET_MM reverted -4.0 → -2.0 (full circle from v0.04).
#         Sampling changed from max → min of boundary anchor Z values.
#         Curved-surface implementation preserved behind TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED flag
#         (default False; same pattern as SAND_RAKE_ALIGN_TO_MAJOR_AXIS).
#         When TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED=False: _compute_trap_surface_from_fringe
#         returns a Z-map filled with the scalar min value (caller signature stable).
#         Floor guard reverts to per-slab scalar (trap_base_z + 0.5mm) since
#         base_z_map is None on the flat path.  Rake + chunks unaffected.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v4.82.
# v0.10 — 2026-09-29 Sienna — exterior OCR markers become fringe/green boundary
#         anchors (task 658).  classify_ocr_markers() in app.py splits OCR
#         markers into interior (elevationMarkers → Gaussian spikes) and exterior
#         (fringeBoundaryHeights → boundary anchors).  In build_fringe_mesh,
#         bnd_z entries at the nearest green boundary polyline point are overridden
#         to the anchor value BEFORE the IDW fringe-Z computation runs (Approach A).
#         This forces fringe Z and green seam Z to match at the interface, yielding
#         a continuous fringe/green surface driven by the exterior number.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v4.81.
# v0.09 — 2026-09-28 Topo — curved trap surface tracks fringe topology.
#         NEW rule: trap_Z(x,y) = fringe_Z(x,y) - 4mm at every boundary point;
#         interior interpolated via scipy.interpolate.griddata (cubic + linear
#         fallback).  Added _compute_trap_surface_from_fringe helper.
#         apply_sand_texture gains base_z_map=(xy,z) kwarg; rake and chunks
#         applied additive on curved base.  Floor guard now per-vertex on
#         curved surface (local_base_z + 0.5mm).  Fallback to flat
#         TRAP_THICKNESS_MM when no adjoining fringe within the 6mm band.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v4.80.
# v0.08 — 2026-09-27 Topo — fix #614: mixed up/down sand chunks + count bump.
#         SAND_CHUNK_UP_FRACTION=0.5 (50/50 up/down by default).  Sign is drawn
#         from the seeded RNG so pattern is reproducible per trap.  Floor guard
#         prevents dimples pushing top vertices below trap_base_z + 0.5 mm.
#         Count bump: density 0.3→0.5, max 20→30, min 3→4.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v4.67.
# v0.07 — 2026-09-26 Topo — fix #610: two-part trap tweak.
#         Item 1: rake direction reverted to fixed Y-axis (PCA major-axis logic
#         from task #606 preserved behind SAND_RAKE_ALIGN_TO_MAJOR_AXIS=False).
#         Item 2: SAND_CHUNK_SIGMA_MM widened 1.5→3.0 mm (~4× footprint area);
#         count and height unchanged.  Overlap upper bound updated to 3-chunk.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v4.66.
# v0.06 — 2026-09-26 Topo — fix #608: replace sinusoidal jitter with sparse
#         sand-chunk scatter.  Remove SAND_JITTER_AMPLITUDE_MM.  Add Gaussian
#         mound bumps (SAND_CHUNK_HEIGHT_MM=0.6, SAND_CHUNK_SIGMA_MM=1.5,
#         SAND_CHUNK_DENSITY_PER_100_MM2=0.3, SAND_CHUNK_MAX=20, SAND_CHUNK_MIN=3).
#         Bumps applied after rake pass; reproducible per-trap hash seed.
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v4.65.
# v0.05 — 2026-09-26 Topo — fix #606: four-part trap tweak.
#         Item 1: rake direction = PCA major axis per trap (SVD on exterior ring
#         vertices; cosine wave driven by minor-axis projection).
#         Item 2: spatially-smooth per-trap-seeded jitter on top of rake cosine
#         (SAND_JITTER_AMPLITUDE_MM=0.08 mm; two-wave sum keyed on centroid hash).
#         Item 3: BOUNDARY_HEIGHT_CAP_ENABLED=False suspends frame-edge Z cap
#         (lift still applied; frame outer wall provides vertical cutoff); note
#         that the frame is a puzzle-base slab — no Boolean clip exists, so
#         poke-through above 9 mm is possible; left to Thomas's discretion.
#         Item 4: TRAP_FRINGE_OFFSET_MM -2.0 → -4.0 (trap 4 mm below fringe).
#         APP_VERSION bumped to v4.64.
# v0.04 — 2026-09-26 Topo — fix #604: two-part trap geometry fix.
#         Part 1: trap frame-edge cap now mirrors fringe cap rule — applied
#         unconditionally (not only on water holes), gated by applyFringeFrameCap
#         (1 mm hard band + 5 mm taper to BOUNDARY_HEIGHT_CAP_MM=9 mm).
#         Part 2: trap height = adjoining-fringe-boundary max Z − 2 mm via new
#         _compute_trap_height_from_fringe helper (TRAP_FRINGE_OFFSET_MM=-2.0).
#         New constants: TRAP_FRINGE_BOUNDARY_BAND_MM=6.0, TRAP_FRINGE_OFFSET_MM=-2.0.
#         export_trap_stls gains apply_fringe_frame_cap kwarg; pipeline passes it.
# v0.03 — 2026-09-26 Topo — fix #600: remove post-texture flatten from
#         export_trap_stls (was wiping rake-line Z variation); set
#         WATER_RIPPLE_ENABLED=False and remove post-ripple flatten from
#         export_water_meshes (ripple was displacing water slab ~0.28 mm low).
# v0.02 — 2026-09-09 Topo — added apply_grass_texture_v2 (cone/pyramid + Poisson
#         + amplitude jitter + XY shear); GRASS_ALGORITHM switch on fringe;
#         FRINGE_GRASS_MIN_SPACING_MM floor to keep Poisson counts sane.
"""
gradient_surface_diagnostic.py — Reconstruct golf green height from arrow gradient directions.

Instead of finding contour lines, we use the small chevron arrows in the green image
as gradient data (each arrow points downhill), then integrate them via the Poisson
equation to get a height map.

Steps:
1. Load EGM, get green boundary via Catmull-Rom interpolation
2. Build dark mask inside green, find arrow blobs with CC analysis
3. For each blob: PCA to find orientation, half-blob spread to resolve 180° ambiguity
4. Build IDW-interpolated gradient field on a 100x100 grid
5. Solve Poisson equation for height Z
6. Save two diagnostic images to owner_inbox/

    Cubic periodic B-spline smoothing of a CLOSED 2D polyline.

    Uses `scipy.interpolate.splprep` with `per=1` (periodic) and a smoothing
    factor `s` that controls how tightly the spline follows the input points.
    A larger `s` means MORE smoothing — the spline deviates further from the
    control points to achieve a smoother curve. `s = 0` reproduces exact
    interpolation (no smoothing).

    After fitting, the spline is resampled at approximately uniform arc-length
    spacing `resample_spacing_px` in the same pixel space as the input.

    This is a much stronger smoother than Chaikin corner-cutting: it fits a
    continuous C² curve that dampens noise below the smoothing scale, which is
    what we need to make the green boundary read as a truly smooth curve
    rather than a densely-sampled polyline with sub-pixel jitter.

# Green boundary XY smoothing (Topo, 2026-08-28 per Thomas — task 677)
#
# The green polygon's outer edge is Catmull-Rom interpolated (16 segments per

# segment is a straight line between spline vertices, and when the polygon is
# rasterized onto the 200×200 fringe/green grids the boundary shows visible
# cell-scale stair-steps where green and fringe meet. Thomas wants the mating
# edge to read as a smooth curve.
#
# Fix: run 2 passes of **Chaikin's corner-cutting** on the interpolated
# boundary polyline BEFORE it is used by any downstream stage (green mesh,
# fringe carve, seam-reseat KD-trees). Chaikin replaces every corner with two
# points at the 1/4 and 3/4 marks of the incident edges — no parametric fit,
# preserves overall shape, converges to a quadratic B-spline in the limit.
# 2 iterations is enough to eliminate visible scallops at typical print scale
# without meaningful area shrinkage (~0.5% at 2 iters on convex loops).
#
# The smoothing is applied to the DENSE polyline returned by
# `interpolate_catmull_rom`, so control-point count and editor behaviour are
# untouched. Existing EGM files render smoother without re-drawing.
GREEN_BOUNDARY_SMOOTH_ITERATIONS: int = 5  # Chaikin passes on the interpolated green polyline — bumped 4 → 5 on 2026-08-31 (task 687) per Thomas: extra corner-cutting on top of the 3× spline `s` bump. Note: each Chaikin pass roughly DOUBLES vertex count (2^N density gain), so 6 iters + 1657 spline pts → 106k pts pushed regen to 94s. 5 iters × the coarser resample below keeps final N ~53k and wall-clock < 60s while still visibly rounding any residual scallops the spline missed.


# Hard-spline smoothing pass (Topo, 2026-08-30 per Thomas — task 679).
#
# Thomas's diagnosis: the prior GREEN_FRINGE_GAP_MM=0.2 tweak (task 677) had
# NO visible effect because the raw Catmull-Rom polyline is still sub-pixel
# ragged. A 0.2 mm gap gets swamped by the raggedness plus the fringe grid
# quantization (~0.88 mm per cell), so the printed pieces still touched.
#
# Fix: BEFORE any downstream stage sees the green boundary, run a **cubic
# periodic B-spline** smoothing pass with a smoothing factor tuned to
# eliminate sub-mm noise. This runs AHEAD of the Chaikin pass — the spline
# fit removes the underlying raggedness, then Chaikin (if still enabled)
# just polishes corners. The result is a genuinely smooth curve that lets
# the small gap actually show up in the print.
#
# `s` (splprep smoothing factor) is the maximum RMS pixel deviation the
# spline may take from the input control polyline. At typical golf-image
# scale (~500 px green boundary), s = 4.0 pushes noise below ~0.5 mm while

#
# BEFORE 677: there was NO explicit code-side gap between the green's outer
# edge and the fringe's inner edge. `build_fringe_mesh` tests each fringe
# grid cell with `green_shapely.contains(sp)` and skips cells that fall
# inside the green polygon. The green mesh and fringe mesh therefore
# shared the same nominal boundary. Effective physical gap = grid-
# quantization noise only. Fringe grid cell ≈ 0.86 mm, so mean unpredictable
# gap ran ~0.43 mm, worst-case ~0.86 mm.
#
# 677 (2026-08-28): added `green_shapely.buffer(+0.2).contains(sp)` to leave
# a deterministic 0.2 mm slit. This had NO visible effect on prints
# because the raw ragged boundary swamped the small tolerance (see the
# GREEN_BOUNDARY_SPLINE_SMOOTHING_PX block above).
#
# 679 (2026-08-30): with the new spline smoothing pass in place, the green
# boundary is now genuinely smooth, so a 0.5 mm gap can actually show up in
# the print. Target 0.5 mm gap — half of the ~1 mm slop the eye tolerates
# on the plaque, big enough to survive one fringe-grid step (~0.88 mm) of
# quantization.
GREEN_FRINGE_GAP_MM: float = 0.125  # bumped 0.5 → 1.0 on 2026-09-04 per Thomas (task 732): 0.5 mm gap didn't stop the slicer's "conflict of gcode paths at layer 30" warning even when measured trap gap was 0.57 mm. Going 2.5× nozzle diameter to rule out path-proximity as the cause. Routes through the `if GREEN_FRINGE_GAP_MM > 0` branch at ~2672 so `green_shapely_exclusion` = `green_shapely.buffer(+GREEN_FRINGE_GAP_MM)`. Halved 2026-09-11 per Thomas — accepts slicer-warning risk to try tighter fit. Halved again 2026-09-12 per Thomas (task 508) — round-2 gap tightening from 0.5 → 0.25 mm.

# in `load_egm` to every polygon of type 'trap' and 'water'. The smoothed
# dense polyline is written BACK into `polygon["points"]` and the polygon is
# tagged with `"_dense_px_points": True` so `_poly_to_dense_px` returns it
# raw (skipping a second Catmull-Rom pass that would re-introduce wiggles).
#
# Separate constants per feature so future tuning is independent (e.g. traps
# might tolerate more aggressive smoothing than water without changing what
# the green does). Defaults intentionally mirror the green so day-1 behaviour
# is the direct trap/water analogue of the green→fringe fix from task 683.
#
# The corresponding *_FRINGE_GAP_MM constants leave a deterministic slit
# between the trap/water outer edge and the fringe cutout inner edge, exactly
# like GREEN_FRINGE_GAP_MM. Default is 0.25 mm as of 2026-09-02 (task 707):
# a standard FDM print-fit slop so the physical pieces mate cleanly instead
# of jamming. The smoothed boundary is continuous enough that a quarter-mm

# ── Fringe grass texturing knobs (task 500, Topo 2026-09-09) ─────────────────
# Root cause of "grass looks like coarse spikes, not grass": the fringe
# watertight-rewrite (task 742) extrudes the polygon at `triangle_args="pq30a25"`
# → max triangle area 25 mm² → ~5 mm effective spacing on the top surface. Then
# `apply_grass_texture` applies per-vertex paraboloid bumps at grassSpacing
# ~1-2.4 mm — well below the vertex spacing → 1 vertex per bump → a spike per
# vertex, not a lawn. Simultaneously the seam-exclude radius (2.0 mm) freezes
# EVERY vertex within 2 mm of any cutout boundary polyline. Because the boundary
# polylines are Chaikin-densified (sub-mm points), that annular band swallows
# ~96% of top-surface verts, leaving only 4% to be grass-textured. Combined:
# the fringe is 96% flat + 4% spikes.
#
# Fix:
#   1. Reduce max triangle area from 25 → 1 mm² so the interior gets ~5× more
#      Steiner points (from ~5000 free verts to ~17-20K free verts on Firefly).
#      Vertex count grows ~10% (147K → 160K); extrude time unchanged (0.3s).
#   2. Reduce seam-exclude radius from 2.0 → 1.2 mm. The mesh boundary is
#      buffered outward by GREEN/TRAP/WATER_FRINGE_GAP_MM (1.0 mm), so the seam
#      polyline (which is the raw, unbuffered boundary) sits 1.0 mm INSIDE the
#      mesh boundary. r=1.2 still catches the mesh boundary verts (dist ≈ 1.0
#      to polyline) with a 0.2 mm safety margin, but frees up ~2× more interior

    Delete every triangle in ``mesh`` whose XY-projected footprint intersects

    Motivation (task 713, Topo 2026-09-02) — same bug class Topo fixed for the
    tee hole in task 703. The fringe's bottom-slab earcut triangulation
    (build_fringe_mesh → polygon-with-holes earcut) can emit a handful of
    GIANT triangles that span half the mesh. When such a triangle's XY
    footprint covers a trap or water cutout, it lands at z=0 UNDER the cutout
    and re-plugs the void — producing the "sand rake stripe" Thomas saw on
    DeLaveaga #11's trap 1 (traps 2 and 3 got lucky, no giant-triangle footprint
    over them). Cell-level `traps_union.contains(sp)` correctly excludes fringe
    top-surface cells inside a trap, but has no visibility into whether the
    LATER earcut on the bottom loop produces a triangle spanning the trap.

    Filter (three vectorised checks per triangle, union → remove):
      (a) any of the 3 triangle vertices lies INSIDE the polygon
      (b) the polygon's representative point (or centroid) lies INSIDE the
          triangle's XY projection (barycentric)
      (c) any of the 3 triangle edges intersects the polygon exterior

    For a convex disk polygon (as used by drill_tee_hole) this matches the
    v/pt/edge test the tee-hole path pioneered — see the disk wrapper below.

    Punch a 2 mm through-hole into the fringe at (x_mm, y_mm) measured from
    the top-left corner of the print bounds, and drop in a reinforcing
    annular collar so the hole walls are thicker than the fringe's baseline
    thickness alone. The collar optionally protrudes ABOVE the fringe top
    surface to give the tee more lateral guidance.

    Strategy — no boolean engine required
    -------------------------------------
    The fringe mesh is chronically non-watertight after all the trap / water /
    grass-texture surgery, so `trimesh.boolean.difference` on it fails with
    "Not all meshes are volumes" on manifold and blender-not-installed on the
    fallback. Rather than try harder to repair the mesh (fragile) we build
    the collar as an independent, closed annular tube — the same trick
    `build_mount_pipe_mesh` uses for the upper-left mounting bore — and
    concatenate it into the fringe.

    Task 748 (2026-09-05) added a pre-extrusion bore-carve into `bottom_poly`
    inside `build_fringe_mesh` so the fringe extrusion NATURALLY builds clean
    vertical walls at radius = outer_r + guard. Since then the fringe arrives
    here with a perfect through-hole already in place, and the historic
    face-removal step (which was needed pre-748 to open the bore) becomes
    DESTRUCTIVE: it hits every wall face along the bore boundary via
    edge_hit, leaving 200+ open edges → non-manifold rim → Bambu Studio
    auto-repair fills the hole. Task 508 (2026-09-12, Topo): detect the
    already-carved bore (no face footprint covers the tee axis) and skip
    the removal in that case. Fall back to the legacy sweep only if the
    fringe still has faces plugging the tee axis (rare, e.g. task 748
    fallback path or an ancient EGM).

    The tube itself is watertight by construction; the fringe's minor gaps
    around the hole are handled by the slicer the same way it handles the
    fringe's other imperfections today.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : trimesh.Trimesh
        The (already-lifted, already-capped) fringe mesh in world mm coords.
        Its outer XY bbox is expected at ±(PRINT_SIZE_MM/2 + FRINGE_XY_EXPANSION_MM/2).
    x_mm_from_topleft, y_mm_from_topleft : float
        Tee-hole location, in mm from the top-left corner of the print bounds.
        Converted internally to world (mesh-local) coords.
    diameter : float
        Inner through-hole diameter (default 2.0 mm — accepts a standard tee).
    collar_od : float
        Outer diameter of the reinforcing sleeve (default 4.0 mm → 1 mm wall
        on each side of the tee).
    collar_protrude : float
        Height the collar rises ABOVE the LOCAL fringe surface at (x_mm, y_mm)
        — NOT the global fringe max. 0 = collar top is flush with the fringe
        surface at the tee position (default). Positive values push the collar
        rim above the local terrain to give the tee more lateral guidance;
        negative values (uncommon) would sink it.  Behaviour changed in v4.27
        (task 699): pre-v4.27 the reference was the mesh's global max Z, which
        put the collar above the local surface on any hole whose tee sat away
        from the frame-edge cap band.

    Task 742 (Topo, 2026-09-05): rewrite fringe mesh assembly using
    ``trimesh.creation.extrude_polygon`` to guarantee a watertight, positive-
    volume mesh.

    The prior fringe assembly (top-surface grid + stitched walls + earcut
    bottom cap) produced 1115 open edges and negative volume on DeLaveaga H11
    (task 738 diagnosis). Bambu Studio auto-repairs the broken mesh, inserting
    phantom filament in visually unpredictable places.

    This helper takes the polygon-with-holes that already describes the fringe
    footprint (frame rectangle minus green minus traps minus water minus bore
    holes) and extrudes it at ``fringe_max_z`` — that produces a clean box with
    correct walls / bottom / (initially flat) top. Then we displace each TOP
    vertex to the sculpted Z sampled from the OLD mesh's top surface, so we
    keep the per-cell terrain variation that the sculpting pipeline computed.

    Displacing only top vertices preserves watertightness (topology unchanged;
    walls & bottom untouched). Boundary top vertices sit on the polygon
    perimeter, so their XY exactly matches the polygon rings — the trap/water
    cutout perimeters and green-cutout perimeter are identical between the
    fringe mesh here and the slabs / green mesh built elsewhere, killing the
    seam mismatch at the source.

    We use the Triangle engine with quality + max-area constraints so the top
    face carries interior Steiner points at ~5 mm spacing, giving enough
    resolution to sample terrain variation cleanly.

    """Build a C²-smooth global height field driven by a 20×20 grid of cell constraints.

    For each of the 400 grid cells:
      - **Default Z**: sampled from ``bnd_z`` via nearest-neighbour KDTree lookup on
        the green boundary polyline ``green_bnd_mm``.  This gives each cell the
        Poisson-derived green-rim elevation at its centre, so the surface smoothly
        extends the green boundary elevation into the fringe everywhere.
      - **User override**: if ``egm_data["gridCellHeights"]`` contains an entry for
        the cell's index (``row * 20 + col``), the value is an **additive mm offset**
        applied on top of the Poisson-nearest default for that cell.  Zero / unset →
        offset of 0 → cell uses the algorithm's natural value unchanged.  Positive
        raises the cell; negative lowers it.  Range ±20 mm, clamped defensively.
        Floored at ``BASE_THICKNESS_MM`` so a negative delta cannot push a cell below
        the base plate (invalid geometry).

    All 400 ``(cell_center_x_mm, cell_center_y_mm, cell_z)`` triples are fed into
    ``scipy.interpolate.RBFInterpolator`` with ``kernel="thin_plate_spline"``
    (inherited from :func:`_build_tps_base`).  The result is a single C²-smooth
    surface everywhere — no kinks at cell boundaries.

    Grid geometry (axis-aligned, origin lower-left of frame):
      - Frame side = ``2 * half`` where ``half = PRINT_SIZE_MM/2 + FRINGE_XY_EXPANSION_MM/2``.
      - Cell ``(col, row)`` centre in world mm: ``(-half + (col+0.5)*cell_side,
        -half + (row+0.5)*cell_side)``.
      - ``cell_index = row * 20 + col``; ``row 0`` = bottom, ``col 0`` = left.

    Parameters
    ----------
    egm_data : dict
        EGM data dict.  ``gridCellHeights`` key (optional) is read as a sparse dict
        ``{cell_index: delta_mm}`` where each value is an additive offset (±20 mm)
        over the cell's Poisson-nearest default.  Both int and string keys are accepted.
    green_bnd_mm : (N, 2) float array
        Green boundary polyline in mm-space (origin at green centroid).
    bnd_z : (N,) float array
        Poisson-derived Z values at each ``green_bnd_mm`` point.  Typically built by
        looking up ``green_cell_z`` at the nearest green grid cell for each boundary
        vertex; ``fringeBoundaryHeight`` anchors may already be injected.
    grid_x, grid_y : (R, C) float arrays
        Meshgrid at which the TPS surface is evaluated.

    Returns
    -------
    (R, C) float array of Z values in mm.

    Notes
    -----
    Degenerate case (empty or absent ``gridCellHeights``): all 400 cells carry
    Poisson-nearest defaults (offsets of 0).  TPS fits a smooth surface that

    # The original design sampled `green_edge_h` by projecting the fringe cell
    # to the SINGLE nearest boundary point, then IDW-averaging Z from the
    # K=4 green cells adjacent to that projection. On a concave green polygon
    # this creates a **hard cliff** in the fringe Z field: as a fringe cell
    # crosses the medial axis of the concave region, its nearest-boundary
    # projection jumps from one edge segment to a DIFFERENT edge segment
    # (potentially on the opposite side of the polygon, at a very different
    # Z). IDW around that projection point can't smooth the flip because the
    # 4 sampled cells all sit at the new projection — the *entire* sampled
    # neighbourhood snaps at once.
    #
    # Fix: sample `green_edge_h` as a spatially-smooth field over the fringe
    # cell's own XY. For each fringe cell, take the K_BND_IDW nearest
    # **boundary polyline points** (from the cell itself, not the projection)
    # and IDW-blend their Z. Each boundary polyline point contributes its
    # closest-green-cell Z. The set of top-K boundary points varies
    # continuously with (x, y), so the sampled field varies continuously too.
    #
    # At the boundary itself (d_to_green → 0) the nearest boundary point has
    # weight → ∞ and its Z dominates, so the seam-match property (task #483:
    # fringe Z equals green Z at the shared boundary) is preserved exactly.
    #
    # Far from the boundary (into the interior of a concave notch), the K
    # boundary points span both competing edge segments, so the sampled Z
    # is a smooth blend of both — no discontinuity.

    # 300 mm-perimeter green with 176 densified points), 24 pts cover ~50 mm

    # its interpolation source, so the anchors propagate automatically.

    # The `gbnd` polyline is very dense (~0.2 mm spacing after Catmull-Rom
    # densification).  A single overridden entry is diluted to near zero in
    # K=24 IDW (the other 23 entries in the nearest-K set stay at natural Z).

    # would introduce at mask boundaries.

    # already the green-boundary truth, so letting it propagate one cell
    # inward actually improves the seam blend. The exact seam vertex Z is

    #
    # Task 719 (Topo, 2026-09-03): jelly-bean trap gcode conflict on DeLaveaga #11.
    # The prior implementation traced boundary loops from `boundary_edges` using a
    # `bot_next: dict[int, int]` (one-next-per-vertex) and treated the largest area
    # loop as the outer ring, the rest as holes. That works when every trap/water
    # cutout produces a CLOSED loop in the wall edges. It FAILS silently when the
    # wall ring around an elongated / curved (jelly-bean-shape) cutout picks up a
    # junction vertex — a vertex with 2+ outgoing bottom edges. The one-next-dict
    # then silently OVERWRITES the earlier edge, leaving orphan chains that never
    # close into a loop. When a trap loop is missing from the earcut polygon-with-
    # holes, the bottom cap FILLS OVER that trap area, and Bambu Studio sees the
    # cap as solid at every layer up to the trap slab's top — emitting "conflicts
    # of gcode paths" for the entire trap footprint.
    #
    # Verified failure mode on [212] for trap_1 (jelly bean, aspect 2.54):
    #   * fringe wall around trap_1 = 31 disconnected chain pieces at z=0
    #   * bottom-cap boundary loops = 4 (frame + green + 2 tee-collar), no trap_1
    #   * fringe cross-section at Z=8: fringe∩trap_1 mesh = 1636 mm² (whole trap)
    #   * layer-slicer intersection: 25 layers of trap_1 conflict, 9 of trap_2,
    #     12 of trap_3 — all three traps have broken wall rings, just trap_1's
    #     failure spans the most layers because it's the tallest.
    #
    # Fix: build the bottom-cap polygon-with-holes from the KNOWN input geometry
    # instead of tracing wall edges. The fringe rectangle is a known shape; the
    # holes are exactly `green_shapely_exclusion`, every `_trap_carve`, every
    # `_water_carve`, boulders_annulus_shapely, and each bore-hole circle. This
    # decouples the cap from the fragile wall-loop tracing (walls can still be
    # slightly imperfect at junction vertices, but the CAP always excludes every
    # trap/water/bore footprint properly). Earcut vertices are snapped to
    # existing bot_verts within a 3-grid-cell threshold, so most cap vertices
    # still share XY with wall bottoms (mesh is as-manifold as before), and any
    # cap vertex that doesn't have a wall partner is added as a new interior

    # from the fringe outer ring + inner cutout loops (green + trap + water).
    # Even when a trap loop IS classified correctly as a "hole" in the earcut
    # polygon, the earcut can still emit a triangle whose XY footprint spans
    # the trap area (numerical edge cases, sliver loops, holes not classified
    # as such when their area happens to sort ahead of another).  On DeLaveaga
    # #11 [197], trap 1 had 811 fringe faces overlapping its footprint — one
    # single triangle of area 2050 mm² covered the entire 1928 mm² trap — while
    # traps 2 and 3 got lucky (0 overlap each).  Result: the visible
    # sand-rake-stripe on trap 1 where the z=0 slab z-fights with the trap.
    #
    # Fix: after the fringe mesh is assembled, run the shared
    # `_remove_faces_whose_footprint_overlaps_polygon` utility for every trap
    # and water polygon (buffered by the same *_FRINGE_GAP_MM used for the
    # cell-carve above, so the removed footprint matches the intended cutout
    # boundary exactly).  Guaranteed: 0 fringe faces cover any trap/water

    # bottom-cap ring bordering the green hole shares vertices with the
    # green polygon exterior, and the polygon-overlap filter (which uses
    # vertex_hit / edge_hit / pt_in_tri) flags every ring triangle whose
    # boundary edge sits on the green polyline.  On DeLaveaga #11 the

    #     DeLaveaga #11 [215]: the very last two faces (idx 51181, 51182)
    #     were two GIANT z=0 triangles spanning the full ±85.2 mm print bed
    #     — an artefact of the emergency fan-fallback in the bottom-cap
    #     earcut path (line ~3696), which triangulates the outer rectangle
    #     WITHOUT the cutout holes when earcut raises. Those two tris cover
    #     every trap footprint at z=0, producing the residual gcode-path
    #     conflict Thomas hit in task 719/720.
    #   • This pass uses `Polygon(trap).intersection(Polygon(face)).area`
    #     directly, targeting the exact failure mode Thomas described in
    #     task 720: "XY footprint interior overlap > 0.5 mm²". Slower per
    #     candidate than the vertex-based test, but bbox-narrowed first and

    # ── NEGATIVE-EXTRUSION SWEEP (task 734, Topo 2026-09-05) ─────────────────
    # Thomas's directive: treat the union of ALL raw carve polygons (green +
    # every trap + every water) as a HARD EXCLUSION ZONE for the fringe. Any
    # fringe geometry whose XY footprint has ANY interior overlap with those
    # polygons is REMOVED — no inward buffer, no protection for boundary walls,
    # no tolerance. Fringe filament is ABSENT inside those regions, period.
    #
    # Rationale: 8 prior rounds tuned inward buffers / gap constants and still
    # tripped Bambu Studio's "conflict of gcode paths" warning. Rather than
    # trusting the carve to leave a clean hole, we now enforce the clearance by
    # post-assembly negative extrusion — anything overlapping the raw carve
    # union gets stripped from the fringe filament regardless of provenance.
    #
    # Two-filter union of dropped faces:
    #   (a) XY-triangle-interior overlaps hard_exclusion_zone with area > 0.0001
    #   (b) ANY 1 of the 3 XY vertices lies strictly inside hard_exclusion_zone
    #       (catches vertical wall faces whose XY area is zero — the area test
    #       misses those because their triangle degenerates to a segment).

    # Supersedes task 728 (which used a −0.15 mm inward buffer to protect
    # boundary walls); with the walls now legitimately expected to sit outside

    Return the target top-surface height for a trap slab (mm).

    "Adjoining fringe" is defined as fringe vertices within
    TRAP_FRINGE_BOUNDARY_BAND_MM of the trap exterior.  This correctly

    Sequencing note: ``fringe_mesh`` must be the FLAT (pre-texture,

    Return per-point trap surface Z values (mm) for an arbitrary set of XY

    Dispatch
    --------
    Behaviour is controlled by the module-level flag ``TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED``:

    **TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED = True** (default, v0.12):
        Per-point curved surface.  For each boundary ring sample the **nearest**
        fringe vertex Z is found (nearest-neighbour lookup), giving a true per-point
        offset: ``trap_Z = fringe_Z_nearest + offset_mm``.  Interior points are
        filled via ``scipy.interpolate.griddata`` cubic + linear fallback.
        Gap between trap edge and fringe is uniform (``|offset_mm|`` mm) at every
        boundary point, regardless of fringe slope.

    **TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED = False** (v0.11 fallback):
        Flat scalar surface.  All query points return the same value:
            Z = min(fringe boundary Z within band) + offset_mm
        This is the "flat min" rule: trap sits ``|offset_mm|`` mm below the
        *lowest* fringe point around its perimeter.  On sloped fringe, the gap
        at the high end is larger than offset_mm.

    Caller stability
    ----------------
    Both paths return ``np.ndarray`` of shape ``(N,)`` — the flat path fills
    every element with the scalar, so the caller signature is identical.

    Fallback
    --------
    If ``fringe_mesh`` is None, or the fringe mesh has no top-surface vertices,
    every query point returns ``TRAP_THICKNESS_MM`` (flat slab fallback).
    The ``boundary_band_mm`` parameter is only used by the flat (False) path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    trap_poly_mm : ShapelyPolygon
        Trap footprint in world mm coords (post-inset).
    fringe_mesh : trimesh.Trimesh or None
        Flat (pre-texture, pre-lift) fringe mesh in world mm coords.
        Top-surface verts have z > 0.
    query_xy : np.ndarray, shape (N, 2)
        XY positions at which to evaluate the trap surface Z.

    For every polygon of type 'trap' in egm_data, build a flat inset slab.

    When ``write_stls`` is True (default), each trap is exported to
    {stl_dir}/{slug}_trap_N.stl and a list of file paths is returned. When
    ``write_stls`` is False, no disk I/O is performed and a list of
    ``(node_name, trimesh.Trimesh)`` tuples is returned instead — the pipeline
    consumes those directly for the 3MF without round-tripping through disk.

    stl_dir defaults to the course's STLs/ folder (via course_paths), falling
    back to OWNER_INBOX if the course is unknown. It is only used when
    ``write_stls`` is True.

    Uses Catmull-Rom interpolation (matching the editor), applies the same
    px→mm transform as the green, insets by PRINT_TOLERANCE_MM, and extrudes
    to a height derived from the fringe boundary (falls back to TRAP_THICKNESS_MM
    if fringe_mesh is unavailable).

    Task #604 changes
    -----------------
    * Trap height: now computed by _compute_trap_height_from_fringe, which
      samples fringe Z within TRAP_FRINGE_BOUNDARY_BAND_MM of the trap
      perimeter and subtracts TRAP_FRINGE_OFFSET_MM (2 mm), placing the trap
      top 2 mm below the adjoining fringe rim.

    * Frame-edge cap: ``_apply_lift_and_cap`` is now called unconditionally
      (not only on water holes), gated by ``apply_fringe_frame_cap``.  When
      True, top-surface vertices within BOUNDARY_CAP_BAND_MM of the plaque
      frame are clipped to BOUNDARY_HEIGHT_CAP_MM with a BOUNDARY_CAP_TAPER_MM
      taper — exactly matching fringe behaviour.  When False, no cap is applied
      (mirrors ``applyFringeFrameCap=False`` on fringe).

    Parameters
    ----------
    apply_fringe_frame_cap : bool
        Mirror of the EGM-level applyFringeFrameCap flag.  Default True.
        When False, the boundary-band cap is skipped for traps (same as fringe).

    **Annulus mode** (water-carved): when a boulders polygon geometrically
    encloses at least one water polygon (full-ring containment —
    `boulders_sp.covers(water_sp)` — never a centroid-only check), the
    boulders mesh is the difference boulders_poly MINUS the union of those
    enclosed water polygons. `covers` (not `contains`) is the predicate of
    record so frame-edge-sharing water polygons (the standard output of the
    boundary-region derivation in task #463) still register as enclosed.
    The resulting Shapely polygon has one or more interior rings (holes).
    `_build_slab_from_shapely` / `trimesh.creation.extrude_polygon` handle
    holed polygons natively.  Height treatment mirrors water: fringe-Z minimum
    over the annulus footprint so the slab sits flush in the carved recess.
    Scene name starts with "boulders" → extruder 5.

    **On-top mode** (v3.20 fallback): when no water polygon is enclosed, the
    boulders mesh is a filled flat slab sitting above the surface at the fringe
    Z minimum, same as the previous implementation.

    The fringe carving for annulus-mode boulders is handled in
    `build_fringe_mesh`, which collects boulders-annuli in the same
    `_carve_shapely` list as traps and water.

    Apply parallel rake-line displacement to the top surface of a trap slab mesh.

    Simulates a freshly raked sand trap: evenly spaced parallel ridges and
    grooves running across the flat top face, matching the look of a wide-toothed
    rake pulled across real golf course sand.

    The top surface is REBUILT as a regular rectangular grid rather than
    subdividing the original irregular triangle mesh.  A regular grid guarantees
    that vertices are evenly spaced along the minor axis, so the cosine wave is
    sampled cleanly and produces perfectly parallel rake lines with no herringbone
    artifacts.

    Task #606 changes
    -----------------
    * **Rake direction = trap major axis** (PCA-derived per trap).  The cosine
      wave varies along the *minor* axis (across the trap's short dimension) so
      ridges run parallel to the *major* axis (along the trap's long dimension).
      This is the "raked across the narrow direction" look.

      Implementation: SVD on exterior-ring vertices gives the PCA axes.  The
      minor axis projection drives the cosine; major axis projection is constant
      within each ridge.

    Task #610 changes
    -----------------
    * **v0.25 (2026-10-15): reversed again** — SAND_RAKE_ALIGN_TO_MAJOR_AXIS is
      True by default; axis = area-moment long axis (_polygon_long_axis).
    * (historical) Rake direction was reverted to fixed Y-axis (flag
      = False).  Ridges run parallel to Y for every trap regardless of shape.
      The PCA path is preserved behind the flag for future re-enablement.

    Task 708 changes (2026-10-04)
    -----------------------------
    * **Sand chunks stripped** — _scatter_sand_chunks removed; step 7 is gone.
      Trap top is now flat base + cosine rake only.  No Gaussian bumps, no floor guard.
    * **base_z_map** still accepted (API stable) for the curved-surface code path
      (TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED=True), but the chunk floor guard that used it is gone.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    1. Extract the original top-face boundary as a Shapely polygon.
    2. Generate a regular (x, y) grid over the bounding box; keep only points
       inside the polygon.
    3. Determine rake axis: fixed Y (default) or PCA major axis (flag).
    4. Project grid/ring points onto minor axis → cosine displacement dz.
       Z = base_Z + dz.
    5. Delaunay-triangulate the grid points; discard triangles whose centroid
       falls outside the polygon.
    6. Reassemble: new grid top + original wall/base faces; merge boundary
       vertices with trimesh process=True to restore watertightness.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh         : trimesh.Trimesh — closed watertight trap slab in mm coords.
    amplitude    : peak-to-trough height of rake ridges in mm (default 0.35 mm).
    grain_spacing: centre-to-centre distance between rake-line peaks in mm
                   (default 1.5 mm).
    trap_index   : integer — reserved; chunk RNG removed (task 708).
    base_z_map   : tuple (base_xy, base_z) or None.  When provided, supplies
                   a curved base surface; grid points sample from it via
                   nearest-neighbor lookup.  When None, the flat z_max is used
                   (flat-slab behaviour, same as before).

    Returns the mesh modified in place (also returns it for convenience).

    Apply two-superposed-sine "wind chop" displacement to a water slab top face.

    Cloned from :func:`apply_sand_texture` (same 6-stage pipeline: rebuild top
    as a regular grid → displace Z → Delaunay re-triangulate → stitch boundary
    ring → reassemble + watertight repair).  Two changes vs. sand:

      * **Displacement formula** — sum of two sine waves at near-perpendicular
        angles with per-pond random phases:

            dz(x,y) = A1 * sin(2π * (x·cosθ1 + y·sinθ1) / λ1 + φ1)
                    + A2 * sin(2π * (x·cosθ2 + y·sinθ2) / λ2 + φ2)

        Then **clamped to dz ≤ 0** so peaks never poke above the unrippled
        water height (which would create overhangs and let the slab visually
        float above its fringe socket).  Net displacement is downward only,
        with the original water_z as the calm-water "high tide" line.

      * **Per-pond seed** — derived from a hash of the polygon's control-point
        coordinates so the same pond regenerates the same ripple every build,
        but adjacent ponds in the same hole look different.  θ1 ∈ [0, 2π),
        θ2 ≈ θ1 + π/2 with small jitter, φ1, φ2 ∈ [0, 2π).

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh             : trimesh.Trimesh — closed watertight water slab in mm coords.
    water_index      : 1-based pond index (used as a fallback seed if no
                       control points are provided).
    control_points_px: optional list of {"x","y"} dicts from the EGM polygon.
                       Hashed to seed the per-pond RNG.  Falls back to
                       water_index if missing/empty.
    A1, A2           : peak amplitudes in mm (defaults: WATER_RIPPLE_A1/A2).
    lambda1, lambda2 : wavelengths in mm (defaults: WATER_RIPPLE_LAMBDA1/2).
    grid_step        : XY sampling step in mm (default WATER_RIPPLE_GRID_STEP).

    Returns the mesh modified in place (also returns it for convenience).

    Post-process a trimesh-written 3MF to add per-object extruder assignments
    that Bambu Studio / OrcaSlicer understand, and inject a complete
    project_settings.config so Bambu Studio loads without its 'invalid config'
    warning dialog.

    trimesh.Scene.export writes a single ``3D/3dmodel.model`` file with one
    ``<object id="N" name="geometry_K" ...>`` per scene geometry, in the same
    order they were added to the Scene. Bambu reads extruder assignments out
    of ``Metadata/model_settings.config`` (one ``<object id="N">`` block per
    model object, with a ``<metadata key="extruder" value="M"/>`` child and
    a matching ``<part>`` block).

    This function:
      1. Opens ``path_3mf`` as a zip and parses ``3D/3dmodel.model``.
      2. Reads each ``<object>``'s id (and name attribute, e.g. "geometry_0").
      3. Pairs that ordered list with ``scene_names`` (same order — both come
         from Scene.geometry insertion order) to derive the extruder via
         ``_filament_for_scene_name``.
      4. Writes a fresh ``Metadata/model_settings.config`` into the zip.
      5. Writes ``Metadata/project_settings.config`` from the template at
         app/templates/bambu/project_settings.config (verbatim copy).
         If the template is missing, logs a WARNING and skips step 5 only —
         step 4 still completes (graceful fallback).
      6. Ensures ``[Content_Types].xml`` declares the 'config' extension so
         Bambu Studio's content-type validator accepts the .config files.

    If counts don't line up, falls back to extruder=1 for everything and
    prints a warning rather than silently mis-tagging.

    Printer assumption: the bundled template was exported from Bambu Studio
    with a Bambu Lab A1 0.4 nozzle profile (printer_settings_id =
    'Bambu Lab A1 0.4 nozzle'). This is Thomas's machine. Bambu Studio accepts
    same-model profiles without complaint; no dialog appears. If a different
    printer is used the profile keys may differ but geometry still loads.

        skip the derivation. When None (default), fall back to the
        ``includeBoundaryRegion`` flag persisted inside the EGM file.
    apply_fringe_frame_cap : bool | None, optional
        When True (default), the water-hole rule clips fringe top vertices
        within BOUNDARY_CAP_BAND_MM of the plaque frame perimeter to
        BOUNDARY_HEIGHT_CAP_MM (preserves legacy behavior). When False, the
        fringe cap is skipped and the fringe rises to its natural height even
        where it exceeds the frame. Green/trap/water caps are unaffected.
        When None, fall back to the ``applyFringeFrameCap`` flag persisted
        inside the EGM file (missing → True).
    include_fringe_without_grass : bool | None, optional
        When True, a second plate is generated holding a smooth (grass-less)
        fringe sample named "fringe_no_grass_sample".  Plate 1 ALWAYS has
        grass applied unconditionally — this flag only controls whether a
        second plate is produced.  When False (default), a single plate is
        generated with the grassy fringe.  When None, fall back to the
        ``includeFringeWithoutGrass`` flag persisted inside the EGM file
        (missing → False).
    serial : int | None, optional
        Global serial number for this generate run.  Obtained by the caller
        via ``commit_global_serial()`` BEFORE calling run_pipeline.  When
        None, the serial is omitted from the filename.
