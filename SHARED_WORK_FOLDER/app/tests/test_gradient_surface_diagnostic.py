"""
test_gradient_surface_diagnostic.py  —  Geometry tests for trap rake / water surface.

Bug→TDD:  tests written first (RED); fixed by:
  1. Removing the post-texture flatten from export_trap_stls  (trap rake lines).
  2. Setting WATER_RIPPLE_ENABLED = False and removing the post-ripple flatten
     from export_water_meshes  (water smooth-flat slab at correct height).
  3. Trap frame-cap parity: apply the same BOUNDARY_CAP_BAND_MM/TAPER cap that
     fringe receives to trap meshes always (not just on water holes), gated by
     the EGM-level applyFringeFrameCap flag.
  4. Trap top height = adjoining fringe max Z − TRAP_FRINGE_OFFSET_MM (2 mm below
     the highest fringe point on the trap boundary), not interior fringe max.
  5. (Task #606) Rake direction = trap major axis (PCA), jitter noise, cap
     suspension toggle, TRAP_FRINGE_OFFSET_MM -2 → -4 mm.

Covers
------
  A. Trap rake lines — after apply_sand_texture the top surface must carry
     parallel-ridge Z variation.  Tests also confirm the production file no
     longer contains the post-texture flatten block that was wiping the texture.

  B. Water smoothness — water top surface must be flat at the intended slab
     height.  Tests confirm WATER_RIPPLE_ENABLED is False (so no displacement)
     and that the production file no longer contains the post-ripple flatten
     (which was collapsing the slab to the deepest ripple point, ~0.28 mm low).

  C. Trap frame-cap parity (Part 1): trap mesh vertices within
     BOUNDARY_CAP_BAND_MM of the frame edge must be clipped to
     BOUNDARY_HEIGHT_CAP_MM, regardless of whether the hole has water.
     When applyFringeFrameCap=False the cap is skipped for traps too.

  D. Trap height from adjoining fringe (Part 2): trap top = fringe_boundary_max
     − TRAP_FRINGE_OFFSET_MM; fallback to TRAP_THICKNESS_MM when no fringe mesh;
     multi-fringe (two adjoining fringes) uses the higher of the two.

  E. (Task #606) Rake axis = trap major axis (PCA-derived per-trap).
     A trap rotated 30° from X must have rake ridges parallel to its long axis.
     A Y-aligned trap must still produce rakes along Y (regression).

  F. (Task #606) Jitter noise on top of rake lines.
     Same trap → two calls → identical Z values (reproducible).
     Two different traps → different noise patterns.
     Peak-to-peak jitter ≤ SAND_JITTER_AMPLITUDE_MM * 2 + epsilon.

  G. (Task #606) BOUNDARY_HEIGHT_CAP_ENABLED toggle.
     When False: frame-edge vertices keep natural height, no 9-mm clamp.
     When True: existing cap behavior is restored.

  H. (Task #606) TRAP_FRINGE_OFFSET_MM updated from -2.0 to -4.0.

class TestCurvedTrapSurfacePerPoint:

    Task v0.12 (2026-09-30): fix curved path + flip default.

    Bug: TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED was False (default), and the curved path used
    max(fringe Z within band) per ring sample — not the fringe Z AT that point.
    On a sloped fringe with 6 mm low and 12 mm high, the max-based path placed
    every boundary sample at 12 - 2 = 10 mm (the global high), so the
    perceived gap at the low end was (12 - 6) + 2 = 8 mm, not 2 mm.

    Fixes:
    1. TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED = True  (default, not False).
    2. Curved path uses nearest-neighbor fringe Z per ring sample point
       (not max within band).  Each boundary sample = fringe_Z_nearest + offset.
    3. TRAP_FRINGE_OFFSET_MM = -2.0 (unchanged).

    RED before fix:
      - N-1: TRAP_SURFACE_CURVED is False instead of True.
      - N-2: sloped fringe → trap edge gap is NOT uniform (low end gap ≠ 2 mm).
      - N-3: flat fringe → all points NOT at H - 2 (depends on fix too).
      - N-4: interior interpolation present.
      - N-5: per-vertex floor guard.
      - N-6: rake + chunks additive on curved base.
      - N-7: flag flip (CURVED=False) still returns flat min.
      - N-8: fallback no-fringe → TRAP_THICKNESS_MM.
    GREEN after fix: all pass.
