## Model Tiers

- **fable** (`claude-fable-5`) — Anthropic's most capable widely released model (GA 2026-06-09). Reserved for long-running agent workloads and top-of-team orchestration. Note: the Agent sub-agent tool's `model` enum does not yet accept `fable`, so this tier currently applies only to Larry (main conversation, switched via `/model`).
- **opus** (`claude-opus-4-7`) — Reserved for roles where novel reasoning, ambiguous problem-solving, deep debugging, or architectural judgment is core to the job.
- **sonnet** (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) — Default for implementation-heavy or well-scoped roles following well-trodden patterns.
- **haiku** (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) — Narrow mechanical roles only (bulk lookups, simple transforms).
