# TDD REGRESSION SUITE — v0.12.0 (must FAIL before fix, pass after fix)
#
# Root cause: the LLM drops the AM/PM qualifier when producing time_hint from
# phrases like "9 o'clock a.m.". It emits bare "9 o'clock" (or worse, "9").
# Herman's date_resolver then sees a bare hour for verb=handle → applies the
# "stays ambiguous" rule (correct) → asks AM/PM.  But the transcript already
# had "a.m." — the answer was right there.
#
# Fix:  post-LLM code override in parse_intent() — after the LLM returns,
# check whether the ORIGINAL TRANSCRIPT contains an AM/PM qualifier; if yes
# AND time_hint doesn't already contain one, append the qualifier from the
# transcript to time_hint.
#
# This is belt-and-suspenders with Herman's date_resolver fix (strip "o'clock").
