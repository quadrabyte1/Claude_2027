# V3.27 — Dismissal Reason column. New scan_eliminations table records WHY
#          each title was dropped by a scanner filter rule (year, rating, votes,
#          genre, country, plot, only_in_theaters). New Scanner._record_elimination()
#          method called inline at every filter drop site. When "Show dismissed"
#          is checked, the Matches table shows a Reason column populated from
#          scan_eliminations; user-manually-dismissed titles show "dismissed_by_user".
#          Migration: scan_eliminations table added via apply_schema() — safe on
#          existing DBs. Table cleared at the start of every /run alongside
#          matches + titles so it always reflects the current scan only.
#
# V3.26 — Theaters filter title_type short-circuit. _apply_theaters_filter now
#          uses titles.title_type (from the IMDb match row) as the authoritative
#          "kind of title" signal rather than OMDb Type. tvSeries/tvMovie/
#          tvMiniSeries/tvSpecial/tvEpisode are treated as never-in-theaters and
#          skip the OMDb heuristic entirely. Fixes Neagley (tt33539520) and all
#          other tvSeries dropped when their cached OMDb row had empty type.
#
# V3.25 — "Only In Theaters" filter checkbox. When unchecked (default), titles
#          that are still only in theaters (no home-video/streaming yet) are
#          excluded from the matches list. When checked, all titles including
#          in-theaters-only ones are permitted. Detection uses OMDb DVD and
#          Released fields with a 180-day theatrical window heuristic.
#          New OMDb fields cached: dvd, type.
#
# V3.24 — Plot filter: any match whose OMDb plot can't be fetched (HTTP error,
#          timeout, Response=False, Plot="N/A", missing Plot key) is excluded
#          from the matches list entirely — silently, as if it never matched.
#          Only titles with a real non-empty plot string are shown.
#          Fail-open: if no OMDb API key is configured, all titles pass through
#          unchanged (preserves pre-V3.24 behaviour for key-less installs).
#          Fetched plots are cached in title_metadata so re-scans are free.
#
# V3.23 — Config export/import + auto-snapshot on every config save + startup
# integrity check. Three layers of protection against config data-loss:
#   Layer 1: auto-snapshot of scanner.db → db/backups/ on every /config POST
#            (rolling window of 20 snapshots)
#   Layer 2: GET /config/export → JSON download; POST /config/import → restore
#   Layer 3: startup integrity check; missing essential keys triggers a UI banner
#
# V3.22 — (previous version)
# V3.21 — Matches table now flags each row that is NEW since the
# immediately-previous scan. Snapshot of the outgoing tconst set is
# taken in /run right before DELETE FROM matches, into the new
# previous_match_tconsts table; index() diffs it into a per-row
# is_new boolean and the template renders a small amber "NEW" pill
# next to the title. Empty snapshot (first scan, or post-Clear) →
# nothing flagged, so the first-scan experience stays clean.

# V3.15 — allow verification runs and Herman / external tools to redirect
# the scanner at a temporary DB without touching Thomas's live data. The
# ``MOVIESCANNER_DB_PATH`` env var, if set, wins; otherwise fall back to
# the historical default (``MovieScanner/db/scanner.db`` next to app.py).
# Motivation: specialists doing ``app.test_client()`` verification runs
# have twice wiped Thomas's live config. Setting this env var to a mktemp
# path before importing ``app`` makes verification structurally safe.
