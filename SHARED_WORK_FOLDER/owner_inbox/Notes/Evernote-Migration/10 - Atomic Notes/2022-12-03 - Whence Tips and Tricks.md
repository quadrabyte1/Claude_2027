Don't use the tab key when

    editing in the Word application and

    modifying python code

Python is very persnickety about indentation and tab characters are sometimes/sometimes not replaced with a series of spaces. The safe thing to do is to just use spaces (although a bit of a pain at times) to handle the indentation.

Good idea to turn on the 'show paragraph marking' option so you can see where the indentations are in the Word document. Note that all totally blank python lines (yellow highlights) are supressed (deleted) before the python processor runs but that the blank lines bound for the output artifact (blue highlights below) are retained to help with output formatting.

While not strictly necessary, according to python's indentation rules, the use of 'pass' can be very helpful when building a Whence template. For example, in this sample the highlighted line (#51) shows an unnecessary but clarifying 'pass' to mark the end of the for loop started at line 48:

The Whence process creates a file (python_lines.py) which is executed as the last step in the template expansion process. Setting breakpoints in that file can be helpful when debugging your Whence expansion.

Some python conventions and special characters will cause problems for the Whence processor:

- - ☐

    the backslash (\\ line continuation character should not be used

  - ☐

The Word spell checker makes a mess of the page, marking just about everything as misspelled with its red squiggly line, so you can just turn it off when working with a Whence tamplate:
