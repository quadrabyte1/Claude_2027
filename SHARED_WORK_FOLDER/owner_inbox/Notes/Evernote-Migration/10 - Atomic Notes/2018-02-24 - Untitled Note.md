Jim, as you can see from my notes after your suggestions, almost everything you mentioned is addressed. There are a few small issues left to iron out. I highlighted those things still needing your attention:

\

\

\

> I'd conflate Aux Window Manager, aux_local_service_server, and viz_service_client
>
> Are the last two not apps then? And does it make sense to combine them into a single module called Aux Window Manager?
>
> \
>
> \
>
> I'd conflate cloud_to_robot and cloud_uploader
>
> Call the new combined module Cloud Service?
>
> \
>
> \
>
> interfaces/examples/generate_events.cc can be omitted
>
> gone
>
> \
>
> I'd rename Libraries Apps Manifest to something more like "Manifest" or "Manifest Infrastructure" or something like that. This represents infrastructure for parsing and processing the manifests that go inside apps.
>
> renamed to Manifest Infrastructure
>
> should I remove the "Library..." prefix on all of the modules in the "Library" domain? it doesn't seem like it adds any clarity to the names
>
> \

> Libraries Apps Server isn't really a module. Most of what's there belongs more rightfully in other modules. In particular:
