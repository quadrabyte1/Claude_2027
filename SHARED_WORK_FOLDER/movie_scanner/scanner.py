"""scanner.py — core Scanner class for the movie_scanner library.

This module is the primary public entrypoint. It is deliberately free of
Flask, Jinja2, or any HTTP-server dependency — it can be imported cleanly
inside Homunculus or any other Python context.

        ------------
        - Opens and closes its own connection (one line, no shared state).
        - INSERT OR IGNORE so a double-call for the same tconst (shouldn't

        - Reason codes are short, human-readable strings like "year:2020<2026"
          or "only_in_theaters:filter_dropped". No structured columns — a single
          TEXT column is enough for the display use case and is trivially

        Steps
        -----
        1. Download today's basics + ratings dumps (resumable, atomic).
        2. Stream basics; skip already-seen tconsts (delta only).
        3. For each new tconst: apply exclude_genres → rating/vote filter →
           include_genres filter. Titles that survive all three are matches.
        4. Bulk-insert new titles and matches; update the run row.
