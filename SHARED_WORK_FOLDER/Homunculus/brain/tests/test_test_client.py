"""Tests for the v1.2.1 in-browser test client.

Three concerns covered here:

1. The static page is mounted and served at ``/test/``.
2. ``CaptureResponse`` echoes the parsed intent (the brain gap the boss
   identified — without this, the page can't reliably post a
   ``/capture/confirm`` request without trying to reconstruct the intent
   from visible fields, which is brittle).
3. The full capture → confirm → upcoming → ack journey works *through
   the test client's wire format* — same JSON the browser sees on the
   page, against the live FastAPI app.
4. ``GET /reminders/upcoming?include_fired=true`` returns rows that
   ``include_fired=false`` would hide (test-client affordance for
   eyeballing just-fired strikes during live testing).

No Ollama. ``OLLAMA_BASE_URL`` points at a closed port so the heuristic
fallback fires (matching the existing journey test).
