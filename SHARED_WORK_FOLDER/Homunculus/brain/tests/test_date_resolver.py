# --- v1.2.2 regression: ambiguous-time bug ("Feed Jake at 5:35") -------------
#
# Bug observed 2026-06-10 17:31:40 EDT: utterance "Feed Jake at 5:35" was
# resolved as Thursday June 11 at 05:35 AM. The user almost certainly meant
# 17:35 today (4 minutes from "now"). Two problems:
#   1. AM/PM was ambiguous and the resolver silently chose AM.
#   2. The chosen default ("AM tomorrow") is ~12 hours further away than the
#      nearest-future interpretation.
# Per the locked UX rule ("Missing info: one specific clarifying question")
# and Rune's persona ("ambiguous_fields is a first-class output; never
# silently guess"), a bare hour:minute in the 1-12 range with no AM/PM
# marker and no 24-hour context (hour 0 or 13+) must surface as ambiguous
# and the router must ask. Tests below cover the regression and the edges
# we must NOT regress (explicit am/pm, 24-hour times, named time-of-day).
