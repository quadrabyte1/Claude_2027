"""Deterministic date/time resolution.

The LLM is good at extracting the *words* ("Thursday at 10am", "tomorrow
morning"). It is unreliable at turning those words into an actual calendar
date. Everything below is pure Python so the math is testable and never
guesses.

v2.5.2 — word-form hour normalisation.

Sprite's on-device LLM sometimes emits the spoken word rather than the digit
in ``time_hint`` (e.g. "three" instead of "3"). The previous regex only
matched digit forms, so word-form hints would fall through to a clarifying
question, bypassing Signals A, B, and C.

A word → digit normalisation pass now runs before the regex so that all
three signals get a chance to fire for word-form hints.  Only hour words
one–twelve are mapped; this is a pure string normalisation and does not
affect any existing digit-form paths.

v2.5.0 — AM/PM disambiguation overhaul.

Three layered signals reduce clarifying-question rate from >50 % to ~5 %:

  Signal A — verb / meal / profession context keywords
             "breakfast" → AM, "dinner" → PM, "plumber" → business-hours PM,
             "gym" → AM, "bedtime" → PM.  Data-driven dict; 1-line additions.

  Signal B — speaker-time roll-forward
             Pick the nearest future interpretation of a bare hour given
             speaker timezone + now.  Sleep window (0–5 AM) is skipped
             unless now is late night (≥ 22:00).

  Signal C — natural qualifier vocabulary
             "in the morning" → AM, "tonight" → PM, "this afternoon" → PM,
             "tomorrow morning" → next day AM, etc.  Regex normalization pass
             runs BEFORE the time resolver so downstream sees a resolved meridiem.

Precedence (highest wins):
  1. Explicit AM/PM in time_hint         → current behavior, untouched
  2. Signal C — explicit natural qualifier in context_text
  3. Signal A — meal / profession / activity keyword in context_text
  4. Signal A (tie-breaker) + existing v0.8.1 schedule+1-5=PM rule
  5. Signal B — roll-forward to nearest future interpretation
  6. Clarifying question (only when all signals fail to narrow it down)

After v2.5.0, clarifying questions about AM/PM are only raised when the
bare hour is genuinely unknowable even with roll-forward — which in practice
means a bare hour with no now context, which cannot happen via the normal
capture path.
