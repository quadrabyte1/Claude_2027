"""Sprite → Herman parsed-capture pipeline (v1.6).

Sprite (the on-device watcher that turns .m4a voice memos into structured
records) POSTs each parsed record to ``/capture/parsed``. Herman decides
where it lands based on the five verbs:

    schedule → calendar event (vault/calendar/) with the full reminder chain
    note     → timestamped markdown in the vault's notes folder
    handle   → reminder markdown in vault/reminders/ with strike chain
    remind   → synonym for handle; preferred for "remind me…" phrasing
    avoid    → append to ``sprite/warnings.md`` (surfaced in morning summary)

v1.6 changes:
  - handle / remind now write to vault/reminders/<event-id>.md instead of
    vault/calendar/.  vault/calendar/ remains for schedule events only.
  - Title no longer carries [handle] / [handle!] prefix — the vault/reminders/
    directory is itself the semantic signal.  criticality is expressed via
    a frontmatter tag ``criticality: critical``.
  - verb=remind is accepted as a full synonym for verb=handle; both route to
    _handle_handle().  The original verb value is preserved in the response.

Design notes:

* **Provenance is preserved** — every stored record carries the source
  ``.m4a`` path in the frontmatter / activity log so we can rehydrate the
  original audio months later.
* **Idempotency is deterministic** — ``verb + subject + when + captured_at``
  hashes to a stable ``record_id``. Herman keeps a small JSONL sidecar at
  ``vault/_capture_idempotency.jsonl`` mapping keys to prior outputs, so
  a re-POSTed record short-circuits with the same response.
* **Warnings live outside the vault by default** — the ``avoid`` path
  writes to ``~/sprite/warnings.md`` (or ``$SPRITE_WARNINGS_PATH``) so
  Sprite and Herman share the same file. The morning summary reads it
  back verbatim (last-N lines).
* **Low-confidence records are rejected defensively** — Sprite drops them
  into a client-side inbox, but Herman still validates the floor. Records
  below ``min_capture_confidence`` return 422 without touching the vault.

    Returns a ``ParsedCaptureResponse`` with ``stored=False`` and a
    ``clarifying_question`` if the hints are ambiguous — the caller must
    return this response immediately WITHOUT writing to the vault.

    Returns ``None`` when resolution succeeded; the caller is then
    responsible for calling ``date_resolver.resolve()`` again to obtain the
    ``resolved_at`` datetime.  (We call resolve twice in the success path to
    keep the control flow in the verb handlers readable — date_resolver is
    pure Python and cheap.)

    The ``verb`` value from the request is forwarded to ``date_resolver.resolve``
    so the resolver can apply verb-specific heuristics (e.g. schedule + bare
    hour 1-5 → assume PM instead of asking). Non-schedule verbs keep the
    original caution.

    v1.9.0 — null time_hint for handle/remind is NOT ambiguous:

    When ``verb in ("handle", "remind")`` AND ``time_hint`` is absent (None
    or empty string), the user gave a day but no time.  That is not an AM/PM
    ambiguity — it is a silent instruction to remind them "sometime that day."
    In this case we return ``None`` immediately (no clarification needed) so
    the verb handler applies the default handle-hour (``morning_anchor_hour - 1``).

    The AM/PM clarifying question only makes sense when the user DID supply a
    time but left it ambiguous (e.g. "at 3").  Asking "AM or PM?" when there
    was no time at all is confusing and blocks legitimate captures.

    This override does NOT apply to ``verb=schedule``.  A calendar event
    without a time is genuinely ambiguous (all-day? TBD? morning?) and should
